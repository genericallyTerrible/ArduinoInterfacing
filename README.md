# ArduinoInterfacing
A repo containing my projects made with the intent of creating a "Serial Monitor" that replacement for Arduino's default monitor. Ease of connectivity and all around functionality are my current goals. Very much a one man WIP.
Warning: I am relatively a noob a coding (~1 year of college study), so things may be broken, bad practices and anti-patterns may be present, and I apologize for my ignorance. Any suggestions, or help is greatly appreciated.
